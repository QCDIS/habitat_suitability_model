# Placeholder

For now this is a placeholder to test if it is possible to generate the report
inside the workflow. Once it is decided which plots and other information is desirable,
the final report will be put here.

```{r random-plot}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir, "monthly_bbox.png"))
```
