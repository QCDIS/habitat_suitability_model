# Habitat suitability model

## About the model/project
Task5.1.2 of the MARCO-BOLO project aims to understand the current and predict the future habitat suitability of several species protected under the Habitats and Bird directive. This workflow can be used to better understand overall monthly trends of a species and assess the evolution of habitat suitability under different climate scenarios.

## How to use
The scripts of the different workflow steps can be found in the code/ folder. The 01_setup.R script is used to define several user choices e.g species. After running each of the chunks in TotalWorkflow.Rmd, run 12_report.Rmd to get more information on the input data and the model performance (currently still a placeholder).
